# Angular9 Github Profile Viewer Miniproject

This is a simple project I am making in order to exercise in angular programming.

In particular RXJS, libary with with I don't have too much experience with.

The project is going to be in Angular 9 (though I doubt it'll use any modern features) and will mainly focus on services and asynchronous streams (created using the http service).

I will try to use RXJS as much as possible and handle the data asynchronously using the async pipe.

For the project I thought of making some sort of visualization app which makes calls to [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) and allows you to retrieve data specific to some user (like counting how many repositories the user has, how many languages and so forth, basically I will make up what to display as I code the app and read throught the API's documentation).

I am not sure if the app will be useful in any sort of practical way, but I thought that this sort of app, highly dependent on http calls would be suitable for exercising with RXJS operators.
